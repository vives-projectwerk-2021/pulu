About us

We are a team of 21 students, all in our last year, studying ICT at Vives in Bruges. We are going to use our expertise and what we've learned over the years in this all-round group project.

About the project

Our goal is to build a functioning moist sensor network with easy implementation to add sensors on the go and by whoever wants or needs it.

We got split into 4 groups, being: DevOps,Hardware,Software and Firmware.

DevOps

DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations.



Hardware

In team Hardware we focus on the most essential item in this project, the hardware. Our job consists out of designing and assembling the print, that will be used in every complete sensor. We make this from scratch. We have worked with multiple prototypes, so that at the end of the journey we get the best result for this project.

Software

We are a team of 21 students, whose job is to build a functioning moist sensor network with easy implementation to add sensors on the go and by whoever wants or needs it.



Firmware

In team Firmware we make the connection between the hardware and backend. For that we make use of the LoRaWAN protocol. The main goal of us is to get the data values from the sensors in the field to the backend. Then we can use these sensor values in the dashboard of the application.
